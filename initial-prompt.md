I want to build a Node CLI personal developer productivity application that will check what I am doing today (I could provide a MD file list or type directly into the interfface) and call an AI to discuss plans and timing with me. 

Important features:
- it should save the current days progress in case it needs to restart. 
- I'd like a nice interface like Gemini CLI where I can type a longer discussion, but also slash commands if I need to change the days todo list, or change other settings. 
- The app is to set scheduled check-in times to check in with me on how things are going and to discuss any problems. There would need to be some sort of scheduler for that. 
- In order to alert me, I want to be able to send notifications. Maybe use `terminal-notifier` or `notify-send`. 

There should be more features than this. Think of a developer's daily workflow and what will be helpful, encouraging, but not too intrusive or overwhelming. Think of building an amazing helpful personal developer coach.

This should work on both MacOS and Linux. Be sure to track changes using git.
